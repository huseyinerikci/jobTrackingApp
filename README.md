# Job Tracking App
Job Tracking App is a ReactJS application developed for job application tracking and management. This application is built using modern web technologies such as ReactJS, Redux Toolkit, Axios, React Router and SASS. The aim of the project is to manage workflows with React and Redux Toolkit and to use these tools in practice.

## Features
* Job Tracking: The application allows tracking job applications in three main stages: "Interview", "In Progress" and "Rejected".
* Data Source: All job data is stored in db.json file and data is loaded dynamically from JSON database using Axios.
* Adding, Deleting and Updating Data: Users can add, delete and update job applications. These operations are managed using Redux Toolkit.
* Notifications: When the operations are completed successfully, visual notifications (toast notifications) are displayed to the user. These notifications are provided by the react-toastify library.
* Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive. It offers a compatible experience for mobile devices and desktop screens.
* Style Management: The project is styled using SASS.
* User Friendly Interface: Icons and symbols for job applications are provided by react-icons library.
* Page Transitions: The application uses react-router-dom to switch between job application and job tracking pages.

# Technologies
* ReactJS: ReactJS was used to create the user interface.
* Redux & Redux Toolkit: Redux and Redux Toolkit were used for global state management, allowing job applications to be added, deleted and updated.
* Axios: Data was pulled from db.json file using Axios.
* SASS: SASS was used for styling, so style management was more organized and scalable.
* React Router DOM: React-router-dom was used for page transitions and redirects.
* React Icons: React-icons library was used for icons.
* React Toastify: The react-toastify library is used for visual notifications when user actions are successful or unsuccessful.
